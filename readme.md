# Adam Riet: Portfolio


## Description
This page will serve as a hub of projects/work I have completed during bootcamp. It will showcase my skills in multiple programming languages. As of right now it will be pretty bare bones but I will be consistently updating it throughout my education. 

## Usage
Over time this page will be a great resource to see examples of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more. 

## Roadmap
As mentioned above this page will be updated with projects of languages I have not learned yet. I will also continue to improve on its HTML structure and CSS styles as I learn more. 

## Authors and acknowledgment
Shout-out to UofU Bootcamp for teaching me coding and for its easy to access resources any time I get stuck.

## Project status
This portfolio will be under construction while I am in bootcamp and beyond. At this time I am focused on mainly improving its CSS to be more advanced.
