    <p>"Better late than never"</p>
    <br>
    <p>I decided to embark on my coding journey at the tender age of thirty-two. After being in sales for over a decade I knew it was time for something new. They say you can't teach an dog new tricks but everything you see on this page is a trick this old dog learned. </p>
    <br>
    <p>My main inspiration would be my loving partner of twelve years. She always pushes me to improve myself and I couldn't have a better supporter in my life.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As far as my life outside of work and school I am as nerdy as it gets. You're more likely to catch me on my computer on Saturday night than out and about.</p>
